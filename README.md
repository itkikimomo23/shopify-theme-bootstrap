## Getting started
There are 2 ways to install our theme (or any other theme for that matter) on your Shopify store. 

1- The simpliest option, is by going to you Shopify Admin and installing the latest package (.zip file) from our [releases](https://github.com/kondasoft/ks-bootshop/releases/). In case you need help with this please check the [official tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/legacy/using-themes/adding-themes#add-a-free-theme-from-the-admin) from Shopify. 

2- The second option is by using [Theme kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/), the the official command line tool from Shopify. This is the option which we will be covering below, as it gives you far more freedom to customize and modify our theme.

### Installation
**Note:** Please, make sure you are familiar with [Theme kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/), official documentation before proceding. We are assuming that at this point you have already installed Theme Kit.

#### 1- Install theme package (.zip file) in your Shopify admin.
Get the latest package (.zip file) from our [releases](https://github.com/kondasoft/ks-bootshop/releases/). and install it from your Shopify admin. Read the [official tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/legacy/using-themes/adding-themes#add-a-free-theme-from-the-admin) in case you need help with this point.

#### 2- Configure theme with Theme Kit
Find the theme id that you have just installed by running the following command:

`theme get --list -p=[your-password] -s=[you-store.myshopify.com]`
