## Installation
**Note:** Please, make sure you are familiar with [Theme kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/), official documentation before proceeding. We are assuming that at this point you have already installed Theme Kit.

### 1- Clone this repository (download theme files)
Create a new folder on your computer, `cd` to it and run the following command to copy all theme files from our GitHub repository master branch. Note: Include the dot at the end of the command to clone into your current directory.

`git clone https://github.com/kondasoft/ks-bootshop .`

### 2- Create and configure theme with Theme Kit
Run the following command to create a new theme in your Shopify store along with our theme files that you have just downloaded:

`theme new --password=[your-api-password] --store=[your-store.myshopify.com] --name="ks-bootshop-v3"`

Optional: Run this command to open your shopify store with our theme in preview mode.

`theme open`

## Customization
It is advised to not directly modify theme files as you will lose changes when you upgrade our theme. The recommended way to handle this is by creating a copy of our theme and then modify it. Please follow this [official tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/legacy/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes) to learn more. 

Also, we have provided 2 blank files (`custom.css` and `custom.js`) which are inside the `assets` folder. It is recommended that you use these 2 files to add your styles and scripts since they will not be changed during the upgrade.

### Modifying styles (SCSS)
We have provided only a few additional styling for this Shopify theme, and all of those are done via plain CSS in the `assets` folder. Our goal for this theme is to provide a solid foundation, completely backed by the Bootstrap framework, so that you can easily get it going with the framework you already know and love. 

All bootstrap related styles and variables are in `src/bootstrap.scss` file. Assuming that you already know how to work with [Bootstrap variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/overview/), feel free to modify this file, especially the color variables in the top of the file.

After that, install all the needed npm packages that are already defined in the `packages.json` file
`npm install`

Now, you can compile the `bootstrap.scss` file that you have just modified using with the following command:
`npm run bs-css` or `npm run watch` (to continuously watch for changes)

To deploy your changes on your Shopify store run the following Theme Kit command:
`theme deploy` or: `theme watch`
